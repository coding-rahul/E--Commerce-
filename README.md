# E-Commerce-
 E-Commerce app based on react,The app is made with React in a Functional Programming like approach.
 Here I create json server that file pasted in E- commerce repositories and I host json server locally in our system to store all dynamic data like Add to cart data , Admin product data , Order data ...
 Firstly go to json_Api2 directory in Cmd.Then we need to start json server using json-server --watch data.json --port 1234 command line 
Running the project go to project directory.
run npm to install packages (just a first time).
run npm start(it runs the app in the development mode and opens http://localhost:3000 automatically to view in the browser)
